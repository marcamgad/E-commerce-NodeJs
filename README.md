# E-commerce-NodeJs
This project is a full-featured E-Commerce web application built using Node.js and Express.js, with a focus on performance, security, and clean architecture. It allows users to explore destinations, search for places, and save their favorite spots to a "Want to Go" wishlist.  The application uses MongoDB with Mongoose for data persistence, EJS for rendering views, and includes essential web security features like CSRF protection and session-based authentication. The codebase follows the MVC pattern and is organized for scalability and maintainability, using custom middleware and utility modules.
